#### What's New
If you subscribe to lots of streaming services or fashion boxes, or anything else with a recurring cost, downloading Daxal can help you see where your money goes each month.

It’s a simple app that’s focused on one thing - keeping track of all your subscriptions. It’s not a budgeting or expense tracking app which means it’s not bloated with features that you don’t need or won’t use.

Simple. Fast. Effective. Download Daxal today and take back control over your recurring subscriptions. 

Features: 
- Quick add popular subscriptions or customize and add your own 
- Summary dashboard for an at-a-glance overview of your monthly costs
- Set reminders so you never forget to cancel or renew your subscriptions when you need to - saves money and time! 
- iCloud sync between devices 
- Dark mode support 
- Customize the app icon and color 
- More features coming soon
