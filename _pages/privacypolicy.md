Seriously, I have no use for it. You bought an app to let you track subscriptions. I donâ€™t want to track you. I appreciate you buying the app and hope you find it useful.


The app uses Cloudkit to sync data between devices. This is the same technology Apple themselves use for things like iPhoto, iCloud Drive, and the Notes app (among many others). I have no way of accessing that data.
